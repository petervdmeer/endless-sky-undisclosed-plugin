# Author ship for Petervdmeer.

# Ship type: Hauler VI (modified)
# Luxurious StarQueen glass type cockpit.
# Left side of ship is fully dedicated to a spinal weapon (chameleon tongue or dragons flame).

# Alternatives considered (but not chosen):
# - Have parts of the Hauler VI detach as separate ships (cockpit as fast attacker with flamethrowers, pods as missile launchers)
# - Have all parts move at very high speed after separation.
# - Have a Sheragi cannon built in into the left 3 pods.
# - Have a Sheragi cannon built into both pod sides (at angle, requiring aiming)
# - Have an anti-matter cannon built in into one side (or in a pod that splits off as a separate ship).
# - Installing skylances on the Hauler VI.
# - No hyperdrive, jumpdrive or keystones (requiring take-off from planet).

# Alternative ships considered (instead of the Hauler VI or possibly as ships flying in formation):
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (flat side front)?
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (point front), with bays and weapons in 12 directions
# - Fighter without drives
# - A ship from ES-Stories (the ESS Bactrian looks very nice)
# - Star Queen Engines variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI)
# - Star Queen Carrier variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI)
# - Marauder Behemoth

			`Some spaceport guy; "great job; forcing the ship to beyond safety limits so that the automated system takes over!"`
			`"Messing up with the systems that much so that auto-landing had to kick in! You are a genius!"`
			`Cameras and media are around to congratulate the captain.`
			# Reporters ask what happened.
			# Experts don't like captain. News media declare captain a hero.

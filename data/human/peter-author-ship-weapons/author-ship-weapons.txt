# Long distance hook/beam that pulls a single enemy ship towards the firing ship.
# Firing ship should have a personality (or weapon) to ensure that the ship stays at long range from the target.
# Minor damage at long distance. Serious shield piercing damage on short range.
# Considered turretted version and segmented version, but the beam version seems to give least undesired visual artifacts.

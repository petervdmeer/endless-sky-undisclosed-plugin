# Author ship for Petervdmeer.

# Ship type: Hauler VI
# Using regular Hauler engines (and Hauler speeds).
# No hyperdrive, jumpdrive or keystones (requiring take-off from planet).



# Alternatives considered:
# - Have parts of the Hauler VI detach as separate ships (cockpit as fast attacker with flamethrowers, pods as missile launchers)
# - Have all parts move at very high speed after separation.
# - Have a Sheragi cannon built in into the left 3 pods.
# - Installing skylances on the Hauler VI.

# Alternative ships considered (instead of the Hauler VI or possibly as ships flying in formation):
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (flat side front)?
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (point front), with bays and weapons in 12 directions
# - Fighter without drives
# - A ship from ES-Stories (the ES Bactrian looks very nice)
# - Star Queen Engines variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI)
# - Star Queen Carrier variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI)
# - Marauder Behemoth

# Very slow ship that uses tractor beam to pull itself towards enemy ships? (beam with hook-type shapes)
# Second tractor/repulsor beam at short distance?
# Flamethrowers around the ship? (Or the Welder?)
# Skylances on the ship?




# Long distance grappling hook (distance 6000?). Beam with small hooks on the side.
# Beam that pulls the firing ship (mostly) and the target ship only minimally.

# Normally ships launch projectiles. In this case the projectile launches the ship.
# Enormous firing-hit-force.
# Projectile travels a short distance.
# Then it splits into 6 sub-projectiles that are beams with some distance.
# Then the end of the 6 sub-projectiles (and the core sub projectile) explode.
# The explosion is disabling, not destroying.
# Black cloud as explosion?

# Very slow ship that uses tractor beam to pull itself towards enemy ships? (beam with hook-type shapes)
# - Beam pulls the Hauler VI (mostly) and the target ship only minimally.
# Second tractor/repulsor beam at short distance?
# Flamethrowers around the ship? (Or the Welder?)
# Skylances on the ship?





# The Hauler VI fightframe. Looks like a regular Hauler VI, but has some changes:
# - The two cockpit sections can separate (3 flamethrowers, very fast)
# - The 3 pods on the left contain an Emerald sword cannon (firing from under the left cockpit)
# - One pod on the right is a "fireworks" pod (containing things like a korath detainer and other cannons)
# - One pod on the right is a "fireworks" pod (containing things like pug seekers, hai tracker pods, sidewinders) some of the missile variants are also under an angle (or maybe even firing backwards, besides the thrust flame).
# - One pod on the right is a "surgical" pod, filled with beam-weapons
#
# The frame is super-slow when all heavy pods are connected/docked.
# The frame is medium-fast when the heavy pods are deployed.

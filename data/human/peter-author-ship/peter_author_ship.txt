# Author ship for Petervdmeer.

# Ship type: Hauler VI (modified)
# Using regular Hauler engines (and Hauler speeds).
# Luxurious StarQueen glass type cockpit (able to connect the two sets of pods).
# Cockpit has firing mechanism at front of each pod.
# Hyperdrive, jumpdrive and keystones

# Alternatives considered:
# - Have parts of the Hauler VI detach as separate ships (cockpit as fast attacker with flamethrowers, pods as missile launchers)
# - Have all parts move at very high speed after separation.
# - Have a Sheragi cannon built in into the left 3 pods.
# - Have a Sheragi cannon built into both pod sides (at angle, requiring aiming)
# - Have an anti-matter cannon built in into one side (or in a pod that splits off as a separate ship).
# - Installing skylances on the Hauler VI.
# - No hyperdrive, jumpdrive or keystones (requiring take-off from planet).

# Alternative ships considered (instead of the Hauler VI or possibly as ships flying in formation):
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (flat side front)?
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (point front), with bays and weapons in 12 directions
# - Fighter without drives
# - A ship from ES-Stories (the ESS Bactrian looks very nice)
# - Star Queen Engines variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI)
# - Star Queen Carrier variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI)
# - Marauder Behemoth

# Long distance hook/beam that pulls a single enemy ship towards the firing ship.
# Firing ship should have a personality (or weapon) to ensure that the ship stays at long range from the target.
# Minor damage at long distance. Serious shield piercing damage on short range.
# Firing ship should have turrets (Skylances?) at short range to deal with the ship being pulled in.

# Normally ships launch projectiles. In this case the projectile launches the ship.
# Enormous firing-hit-force.
# Projectile travels a short distance.
# Then it splits into 6 sub-projectiles that are beams with some distance.
# Then the end of the 6 sub-projectiles (and the core sub projectile) explode.
# The explosion is disabling, not destroying.
# Black cloud as explosion?

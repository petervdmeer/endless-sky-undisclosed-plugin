# The Hauler VI fightframe. Looks like a regular Hauler VI, but has some changes:
# - The two cockpit sections can separate (3 flamethrowers, very fast)
# - The 3 pods on the left contain an Emerald sword cannon (firing from under the left cockpit)
# - One pod on the right has Archon tentacles sticking out and can separate into an archon pod (the animation after launch makes the tentacles bigger and smaller)
#   - This pod fires an archon AM Cannon, but at an angle of 15 degrees. (So it usually misses). The archon is not fully aligned within the pod.
#   - When this pod is moving, then it shows an archon tail.
# - One pod on the right is a "fireworks" pod (containing things like a korath detainer, pug seekers, hai tracker pods, sidewinders) some of the missile variants are also under an angle (or maybe even firing backwards, besides the thrust flame).
# - One pod on the right is a "surgical" pod, filled with beam-weapons
#
# The frame is super-slow when all heavy pods are connected/docked.
# The frame is medium-fast when the heavy pods are deployed.

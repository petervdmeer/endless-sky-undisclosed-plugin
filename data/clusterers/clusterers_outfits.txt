	description "This thruster creates a fractal energy network behind the ship and creates propulsion by energy/mass conversions inside this network outside the ship."
	description "   Heat production is minimal since the thruster operates mostly outside the ship."
	description "   Because the thruster operates outside the ship it is also possible to direct the propulsion and use the network for steering and even for a minimal amount of reverse thrust."
	description "   This thruster can also generate the nuclear explosion as used in hyperdrives and the matter-states as used in Jump-drives, but very inefficiently."
	
# outfit "Bubble Thruster"
#	description "Thruster that ejects pockets (bubbles) of energy packets for propulsion."
